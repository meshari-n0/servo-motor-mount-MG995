## Description
3D printable servo motor mount (MG995) designed using Onshape.

## Usage
This servo motor mount can be used to securely hold an MG995 servo motor in robotics projects, prototypes, and educational applications. It helps provide stability and proper alignment for the servo during operation.

## Tools Used
- Extrude (Add)
- Extrude (Remove)
- Fillet

## Measurement Tools Used
The dimensions of the servo motor were measured using a ruler to obtain approximate values. These measurements were then entered into Onshape, and the Dimension tool was used in the sketches to accurately control the final dimensions.
